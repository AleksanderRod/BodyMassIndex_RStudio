## The Causes of High Body Mass Index (BMI)

The goal of this project is to give the public ideas and actions to help keep one's BMI levels down and stray away from being categorized as overweight or obese.
Our goal will be accomplished using excel, and RStudio to clean the data, analyze the data, visualize the data, and communicate the data. The data for this project 
was found on kaggle and will be linked at the bottom of this README file. After cleaning some of the data on excel, we then used Correlation tests, T-tests, and ANOVA tests
on RStusio to find the variables corrleated to BMI. Then built visuals and predictive models with the data. The files show our resutls and code.
